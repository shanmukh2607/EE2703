My repository of course projects, assignements and material for this course <br>
Jupyter notebooks have crude codes and .py files are clean, well documented. <br>
A question book pdf and a corresponding report.pdf has a good description of the assignment.<br>
The owner of this repository does not encourage plagiarism and strictly instructs to use it as guidance for course.
